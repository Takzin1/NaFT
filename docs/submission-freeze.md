# IEEE ClimateChain 2026 — Submission Freeze Procedure

Do this only when the Devpost copy, video and testnet decision are final.

## 1. Stop feature work

From the intended submission head onward, allow only:

- factual documentation corrections;
- submission-link updates;
- verified testnet evidence;
- critical bug fixes.

Do not add new product scope after the freeze starts.

## 2. Require one exact green head

For the intended submission SHA, require:

- push CI success;
- pull-request CI success;
- GitHub Pages deploy success;
- Solidity ABI + bytecode compilation success;
- browser ClimateChain flow success;
- committed report reproducibility success.

Do not mix evidence from different SHAs.

## 3. Decide testnet state

Exactly one state is allowed.

### A. NOT_SUBMITTED

Keep `src/climatechain-testnet-record.js` completely empty except for the explicit status and boundary fields. Submission copy must not claim public-testnet anchoring.

### B. VERIFIED_TESTNET

Populate every required field and pass the repository validator. Record the same chain/address/transaction evidence in the submission notes.

Never ship a partial hybrid state.

## 4. Record external submission artifacts

Copy these values into a private submission note before pressing Devpost submit:

```text
Final repository SHA:
Public demo URL: https://takzin1.github.io/NaFT/#/climatechain
Repository URL: https://github.com/Takzin1/NaFT
Devpost project URL:
Video URL:
Track:
Testnet state:
Network / chain ID:
Contract address:
Deploy tx:
Genesis anchor tx:
Successor anchor tx:
Submission timestamp:
```

## 5. Freeze the Git state

After the final green SHA is known:

- keep PR #20 open/draft until the submission strategy is finalized;
- create a dedicated release/tag or frozen release branch from the exact submission SHA;
- do not move that frozen ref after submission.

Suggested release ref:

`release/ieee-climatechain-2026-submission`

## 6. Final integrity read

Immediately before submission, open the public demo in a clean browser and verify:

- page title and language are correct;
- the methodology-update button runs;
- 100 / 30 / 70 / 15 / 15 renders;
- representative lineage renders;
- blockchain status matches the repository testnet record;
- no unsupported formal-certification claim appears;
- no horizontal overflow or runtime error appears.

## 7. Final Devpost check

Re-check the live Devpost page for:

- deadline/timezone;
- required fields;
- video duration;
- repository/public-access requirement;
- track wording;
- any last-minute organizer clarification.

The repository cannot guarantee that external competition requirements have not changed.
